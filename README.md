This Python program uses the Monte Carlo simulation technique to forecast the future value of a portfolio of stocks.

# Overview
The Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique that allows us to simulate a wide range of possible outcomes and compute an expected outcome. In this program, we use it to simulate a large number of possible future price paths for a portfolio of stocks, based on their historical price data.

# Method
We start by fetching the historical price data for the stocks using the yfinance library and calculate the log returns.

We then run a large number of Monte Carlo simulations. In each simulation, we generate a series of daily portfolio returns from a normal distribution whose mean and standard deviation are calculated from the historical data.

The portfolio returns are then used to generate a price path for the portfolio.

We store the portfolio's final price in each simulation, and plot a histogram to visualize the distribution of these final prices. This gives us a probabilistic forecast of the portfolio's future value.

We also plot each simulated price path on a line chart, so we can visualize the range of possible future price trajectories.

# Usage
To run the simulation, you need to specify the following parameters:

tickers: A list of the ticker symbols for the stocks in the portfolio.
weights: A numpy array of the weights of each stock in the portfolio.
num_days: The number of days from which to grab historical data and into the future to simulate.
num_iterations: The number of simulations to run.

This program requires the following Python libraries:
yfinance
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
pandas

# Limitations and Disclaimer
This program uses a simplified model of stock price movements, and assumes that the future statistical properties of the stocks will be the same as their historical properties. It does not account for many factors that could affect future stock prices, such as changes in the company's financial situation, market trends, economic indicators, etc.
